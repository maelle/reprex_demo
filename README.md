# reprex_demo

My experiments to share reprexes on Gist and on Twitter.

[script](script.R)

Ideas of workflow to share output from [`reprex`](https://reprex.tidyverse.org/)

* `reprex venue = "md"` + paste in unnamed file + [`gistfo`](https://github.com/MilesMcBain/gistfo)

* `reprex venue = "md"` with `outfile` + `gistr::gist_create`

* one of the above, and `reprex venue = "r"` + [`carbonate`](https://github.com/yonicd/carbonate) to obtain a tweetable screenshot.
